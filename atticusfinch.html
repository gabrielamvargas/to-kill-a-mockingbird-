       <p> Atticus Finch is an attorney at Maycomb County, and is a single father to Jem and Scout Finch. He is a very respectable character, kind and caring. Atticus life is role model to his children. He is consistent with his beliefs and a moral persona. He is a loving, dutiful father and a great lawyer. He is a very integral persona. Atticus always remains true to his conscience, his beliefs and his values, even if the society doesn't agree with it. The greatest example of his integrity is the dedication with which he takes up Tom Robinson’s case. He does his best trying to prove Tom innocent, even though he was being mocked at by the society. Scout asked Atticus why he was supporting Tom while the rest of Maycomb is against him, he says, “The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience". </p>
