       <p> Scout is little girl, both in her own qualities and in her social position. She is very intelligent, unusually confident, unusually thoughtful  and acts with her best intentions. She's a tomboy girl. She's like that because that's the way Atticus raised her. She's not like other girl that wears dresses, she wears overall and climbs trees with Jem and Dill. For her short age she's very smart and questions everything. She's the narrator and the novel is form her point of view.</p>
